Shopify theme customization for Projext<br>
<br>
To protect the source code of the project, I have chosen to omit other folders that contain sensitive information and credentials. Please understand that.

I have included the "sections" folder solely for demonstration purposes, showcasing my fluency and knowledge in Shopify Liquid and theme customization.

Sections starting with `ako-` indicate that they were fully built by me for the merchant. You will also notice CSS class names starting with `ako-` throughout the repository, showcasing a significant level of customization on top of an existing theme.
